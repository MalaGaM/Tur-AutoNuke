Getting tired of nuking people who leave empty folders? How about folders where there
are one or two files missing from the release? How about those folders that only
contains a .nfo because its a dupe from yesterday, or already nuked and someone tried upping again?
No wait, how about those german 0days releases that are not allowed? (or movies for that matter.)
Or perhaps you have a section where only certain group releases are allowed?

This script can take care of that.
